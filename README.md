# Insta_Downloader
## A api-less instagram photos downloader that mimicks human interactions to avoid ban.



This project as the aim to scrape all the photos from a instagram profile,
trying to emulate the normal human-browser interactions.
Please mind that the private scraping can potentialy block your account, so use
it at your own risk. I recommend you to get a dummy account.

## Public profiles:
- You can minimaze the window, it will keep running on the background.
- Your credentials aren't necessary.

## Private profiles:
- While the login process is doing, keep the windown open. After that point
you can close it.
- Your credentials are necessary.
